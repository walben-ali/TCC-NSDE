An *initial condition* can be prescribed to this differential equation which will assign a \"starting value\" for the unknown function $y$ at the starting time as $y(t_0)=y_0$.  The combination of the first order ODE and the initial value gives the ***Initial Value Problem*** (or ***IVP***)\n$$\\tdiff{y}=f(t,y) \\qtq{with} y(t_0)=y_0, \\quad t \\in [t_0,t_f].$$\n\nThere are many analytic methods for solving first order ordinary differential equations, but they all hold restrictions, like linearity or homogeneity.  This chapter will develop the simplest numerical technique for solving any first order ordinary differential equation, this method is called the ***Euler Method***.\n\nConsider the following first order IVP\n$$\\tdiff{y}=f(t,y), \\qtq{with} y(t_0)=y_0 \\quad t \\in [t_0,t_f].$$\nThe function $f$ is known and in most cases, is assumed to be \"well-behaved\" (does not have discontinuities or sharp corners).  The term $y_0$ is known as the ***Initial Value*** of the function $y$ at the starting time $t_0$.  Solving this initial value problem is essentially finding an unknown curve $y(t)$ that starts at the point $(t_0, y_0)$ and ends at time $t_f$.\n\nThe first step in the Euler method (as is the case in most numerical techniques) is to discretise the domain.  This changes the domain from the continuous interval $[t_0,t_f]$ to $N$ subintervals, each with constant[^Consth] width $h$ (sometimes also denoted $\\delta t$), which is known as the ***Stepsize***.  The discretised interval will be the set of points\n$$\\cbr{t_0, t_0+h, t_0+2h, \\dots, t_0+Nh}.$$\n![](figures/IVP_Disc.jpg)\n\n[^Consth]:  In most cases, the interval width $h$ is constant but more advanced numerical techniques have different subinterval widths.\n\nThe aim of the numerical procedure is to start from the starting point $(t_0,y_0)$ and progressively find consequent points until the final time $t_f$ is reached.\n\nThe Euler method uses the gradient, namely $\\tdiff{y}$, at the starting point $(t_0, y_0)$ in order to find the value of $y$ at the subsequent point which will be labelled $(t_1, y_1)$.  This will, in turn, determine the new gradient at $(t_1,y_1)$ and this process is then continued until the final time is reached.  The smaller the value of $h$ is, the more points there will be between $t_0$ and $t_f$ resulting in a more accurate final solution to the initial value problem.\n\nThe accuracy of the Euler method is usually characterised by how small $h$ is or how large $N$ is.  Since the stepsize may not always give an appropriate subdivision (like dividing the interval $[0,1]$ into subintervals of width $0.4$), then the number of subdivisions $N$ can be used to find an appropriate $h$ by using\n$$h=\\frac{t_f-t_0}{N}.$$\n\n## Steps of the Euler Method\n\nConsider the IVP\n$$\\tdiff{y}=f(t,y), \\qtq{with} y(t_0)=y_0 \\quad t \\in [t_0,t_f].$$\n\n:::{.callout-caution title=\"Parallel Example\"}\nThe steps of the Euler method will be explained theoretically and applied to this IVP in parallel to demonstrate the steps:\n$$\\tdiff{y}=6-2y \\qtq{with} y(0)=0, \\quad t \\in [0,2].$$\nIn this case, the function on the RHS is $f(t,y)=6-2y$.  Note that this IVP has the exact solution\n$$y(t)=3-3\\ex{-2t}.$$\n:::\n\n1. Discretise the interval $[t_0,t_f]$ with stepsize $h$ to form the set of points\n$$\\cbr{t_0, t_0+h, t_0+2h, \\dots, t_0+Nh}.$$\n\n:::{.callout-caution title=\"Inverval Discretisation\"}\nSuppose that the interval $[0,2]$ is to be split into $5$ subintervals, then $N=5$ and\n$$h=\\frac{t_f-t_0}{N}=\\frac{2-0}{5}=0.4.$$\nTherefore the discretised points are\n$$\\cbr{0.0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0}.$$\nNote that $N$ denotes the number of subintervals and **not** the number of points, that would be $N+1$ points since the starting point is $0$.\n:::\n\n2. At the starting point $(t_0,y_0)$, the gradient is known since\n$$y'(t_0)=f(t_0,y_0).$$\n\n:::{.callout-caution title=\"Gradient at $\\boldsymbol{(t_0,y_0)}$\"}\nAt the initial point,\n$$y'(t_0)=f(t_0,y_0) \\qiq y'(0)=f(0,0)=6-2(0)=6.$$\nSo the starting gradient is $6$.\n:::\n\n3. The next step is to find the the value of $y$ at the subsequent time $t_1=t_0+h$.  For this purpose, consider the Taylor series expansion of $y$ at $t=t_1$,\n$$y(t_1)=y(t_0+h)=y(t_0)+h y'(t_0)+ \\frac{h^2}{2!} y''(t_0)+\\OO{h^3}.$$\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nThe term $\\OO{h^3}$ simply means that the terms after this point have a common factor of $h^3$ and these terms are regarded as *higher order terms* and can be neglected since they are far smaller than the first terms provided $h$ is small.\n:::\n\nSince $h$ is assumed to be sufficiently small, then all terms higher order terms, in this case $h^2$ or higher, can be neglected (i.e. $h^n \\approx 0$ for $n \\geq 2$).  Therefore\n$$y(t_1) \\approx y(t_0)+h y'(t_0).$$\n\nLet $Y_1$ denote the *approximated value* of the solution at the point $t_1$, i.e. $Y_1 \\approx y(t_1)$, so in this case,\n$$Y_1=y_0+h y'(t_0).$${#eq-Euler1}\nThis determines the value of $Y_1$ which is an approximation to $y(t_1)$.\n\n:::{.callout-caution title=\"Calcuating $\\boldsymbol{Y_1}$\"}\nThe point $Y_1$ can be calculated as follows:\n$$Y_1=y_0+hy'(t_0)=0+(0.4)(6)=2.4.$$\nThis means that the next point is $(t_1,Y_1)=(0.4,2.4)$.\n:::\n\n4. This iteration can be continued to find $Y_{n+1}$ (which is the approximate value of $y(t_{n+1})$) for all $n=1, 2, \\dots, N-1$\n$$Y_{n+1}=Y_n+h y'(t_n) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad y'(t_n)=f(t_n,Y_n).$$\n\n:::{.callout-caution title=\"Calculating $\\boldsymbol{Y_n}$\"}\nThe values of $Y_2, Y_3, Y_4$ and $Y_5$ can be calculated as follows:\n$$Y_2: \\quad y'(t_1)=f(t_1,Y_1) \\qiq y'(0.4)=f(0.4,2.4)=6-2(2.4)=1.2$$\n$$\\iq Y_2=Y_1+hy'(t_1)=2.4+(0.4)(1.2)=2.88$$\n\n$$Y_3: \\quad y'(t_2)=f(t_2,Y_2) \\qiq y'(0.8)=f(0.8,2.88)=6-2(2.88)=0.24$$\n$$\\iq Y_3=Y_2+hy'(t_2)=2.88+(0.4)(0.24)=2.976$$\n\n$$Y_4: \\quad y'(t_3)=f(t_3,Y_3) \\qiq y'(1.2)=f(1.2,2.976)=6-2(2.976)=0.048$$\n$$\\iq Y_4=Y_3+hy'(t_3)=2.976+(0.4)(0.048)=2.9952$$\n\n$$Y_5: \\quad y'(t_4)=f(t_4,Y_4) \\qiq y'(1.6)=f(1.6,2.9952)=6-2(2.9952)=0.0096$$\n$$\\iq Y_5=Y_4+hy'(t_4)=2.9952+(0.4)(0.0096)=2.99904$$\n:::\n\n5. The solution to the IVP can now be approximated by the function that passes through the points\n$$(t_0,Y_0), \\quad (t_1, Y_1), \\quad \\dots \\quad (t_N,Y_N).$$\n\n:::{.callout-caution title=\"Solution to the IVP\"}\nThe approximate solution to the IVP\n$$\\tdiff{y}=6-2y \\qtq{with} y(0)=0, \\quad t \\in [0,2]$$\nis the function that passes through the points:\n$$(0,0), \\quad (0.4,2.4), \\quad (0.8,2.88), \\quad (1.2,2.976), \\quad (1.6,2.9952), \\quad (2,2.99904).$$\nThis is a good approximation since the *exact* locations, as per the exact solution are, (to 4 decimal places):\n$$(0,0), \\quad (0.4,1.6520), \\quad (0.8,2.3943), \\quad (1.2,2.7278), \\quad (1.6,2.8777), \\quad (2,2.9451)$$\nwhich is not bad for such a coarse interval breakdown.\n:::\n\nThe Euler method needs $N$ steps to complete and every step $n \\in \\cbr{1,2,\\dots,N}$ requires finding $y'(t_{n-1})=f(t_{n-1},y_{n-1})$ and $Y_n=Y_{n-1}+h y'(t_{n-1})$.  Of course, the larger $N$ is, the smaller $h$ becomes, meaning that more steps will be required but the solution will be closer to the exact solution\n\nNotice that the terms on the right hand side of @eq-Euler1 are all known and for this reason, the Euler method is known as an ***Explicit Method***.\n\n## Accuracy\n\nConsider the Taylor series expansion for the function $y$ at the point $t_1=t_0+h$,\n$$y(t_1)=y(t_0+h)=y(t_0)+h y'(t_0)+ \\frac{h^2}{2!} y''(t_0)+\\OO{h^3}.$$\nUsing ***Taylor's Theorem***[^TT], this can be written as\n$$y(t_1)=y(t_0+h)=y(t_0)+h y'(t_0)+ \\frac{h^2}{2!} y''(\\tau_1)$$\nfor some point $\\tau_1$ between $t_0$ and $t_1$.  The Euler method determines the approximation $Y_1$ to the function $y$ at the point $t_1$, particularly,\n$$Y_1=y(t_0)+hy'(t_0) \\approx y(t_1).$$\n\nThe ***Local Truncation Error*** at the first step, denoted $e_1$, is defined as the absolute difference between the exact and approximated values at the first step, and this is given by\n$$e_1=\\abs{y(t_1)-Y_1}=\\frac{h^2}{2!}\\abs{y''(\\tau_1)}.$$\n\nThis can be done for all the locations to give a list of local truncation errors $e_1, e_2, e_3,\\dots,e_N$.  Note that *technically*, these errors are hypothetical since the *exact solution* $y$, and thus $y(t_n)$, are not known but these are put as placeholders to establish the full accuracy of the method.  In this case, the local truncation error $e$ is said to be of *second order* since $e=\\OO{h^2}$.\n\n[^TT]:  ***Taylor's Theorem*** states that for a function $f$ that is at least $N+1$ times differentiable in the open interval $(x,x_0)$ (or $(x_0,x)$), then\n$$f(x)=f(x_0)+f'(x_0)(x-x_0)+\\frac{1}{2!}f''(x_0)(x-x_0)^2+\\frac{1}{3!}f'''(x_0)(x-x_0)$$\n$$+\\dots+\\frac{1}{N!}f^{(N)}(x_0)(x-x_0)^N+\\frac{1}{(N+1)!}f^{(N+1)}(\\xi)(x-x_0)^{N+1}$$\nfor some point $\\xi$ between $x$ and $x_0$.\n\nAs the iteration progresses, the errors will accumulate to result in a ***Global Integration Error*** denoted $E$.  In this case, the global integration error is\n$$E=|y(t_f)-Y_N|.$$\nThe global integration error has to be at most the accumulation of all the local truncation errors, namely\n$$E=|y(t_f)-Y_N| \\leq \\underbrace{\\sum_{n=1}^{N}{e_n}}_{\\substack{\\text{sum of all} \\\\ \\text{local truncation} \\\\ \\text{errors}}}= \\sum_{n=1}^{N}{\\frac{h^2}{2!}\\abs{y''(\\tau_n)}}=h^2\\sum_{n=1}^{N}{\\frac{1}{2}\\abs{y''(\\tau_n)}}.$$\n\n$$\\iq E \\leq h^2\\sum_{n=1}^{N}{\\frac{1}{2}\\abs{y''(\\tau_n)}}$$ {#eq-GIEEuler}\n\nA bound for the sum needs to be found in order bound the global integration error.  To this end, consider the set of the second derivatives in the sum above, i.e.\n$$\\cbr{\\frac{1}{2}\\abs{y''(\\tau_1)}, \\frac{1}{2}\\abs{y''(\\tau_2)}, \\dots, \\frac{1}{2}\\abs{y''(\\tau_n)}}.$$\n\nSince all these terms take a finite value, then at least one of these terms must be larger than all the rest, this is denoted $M$ and can be written as\n$$M=\\max\\cbr{\\frac{1}{2}\\abs{y''(\\tau_1)}, \\frac{1}{2}\\abs{y''(\\tau_2)}, \\dots, \\frac{1}{2}\\abs{y''(\\tau_n)}}.$$\n\nThis can also be expressed differently as\n$$M=\\max_{\\tau \\in [t_0, t_f]}\\cbr{\\frac{1}{2}\\abs{y''(\\tau)}}.$$\nTherefore, since\n$$\\frac{1}{2}\\abs{y''(\\tau_n)} \\leq M \\qtq{for all} n=1,2,\\dots,N$$\nthen\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^{N}{\\frac{1}{2}\\abs{y''(\\tau_n)}} \\leq \\sum_{n=1}^{N}{M}=NM.$$\nThus, returning back to the expression for $E$ in @eq-GIEEuler\n$$E \\leq h^2\\sum_{n=1}^{N}{\\frac{1}{2}\\abs{y''(\\tau_n)}} \\leq NMh^2=Mh \\cdot (Nh)=Mh(t_f-t_0)=\\OO{h}.$$\nHence, the global integration error $E=\\OO{h}$, this means that the Euler method is a ***First Order Method***.  This means that both $h$ and the global integration error behave linearly to one another, so if $h$ is halved, then the global integration error is halved as well.\n\nIn conclusion, the local truncation error of the Euler method is $e=\\OO{h^2}$ while the global integration error $E=\\OO{h}$ when $h$ is small.\n\n:::{.callout-caution title=\"Different Stepsizes\"}\nReturning to the IVP\n$$\\tdiff{y}=6-2y \\qtq{with} y(0)=0, \\quad t \\in [0,2].$$\n\nThe Euler method can be repeated for different values of $h$ and these can be seen in the figure below.\n\n![](figures/ODE3.jpg)\n\nThe table below shows the global integration error for the different values of $h$:\n\n| $h$  | $E$ |\n|:----:|:---:|\n| 0.4  | 0.05399 |\n| 0.2  | 0.03681 |\n| 0.1  | 0.02036 |\n| 0.05 | 0.01060 |\n\nWhen the value of $h$ is halved, the global integration error is approximately halved as well.\n:::\n\n## Set of IVPs {#sec-EulerSys}\n\nSO far, the Euler Method has been used to solve a single IVP, however this can be extended to solving a set of linear IVPs.\n\nConsider the set of $K$ linear IVPs defined on the interval $[t_0,t_f]$:\n\\begin{align*}\n& \\tdiff{y_1} = a_{11} y_1 + a_{12} y_2 + \\dots + a_{1K} y_K + b_1, & y_1(t_0)=\\tilde{y}_1 \\\\\n& \\tdiff{y_2} = a_{21} y_1 + a_{22} y_2 + \\dots + a_{2K} y_K + b_2, & y_2(t_0)=\\tilde{y}_2 \\\\\n& \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\vdots & \\\\\n& \\tdiff{y_K} = a_{K1} y_1 + a_{K2} y_2 + \\dots + a_{KK} y_K + b_K, & y_K(t_0)=\\tilde{y}_K \\\\\n\\end{align*}\nwhere, for $i,j=1, 2, \\dots, K$, the functions $y_i=y_i(t)$ are unknown, $a_{ij}$ are known constant coefficients and $b_i$ are all known (these can generally depend on $t$).\n\nThis set of initial value problems need to be written in matrix form as\n$$\\tdiff{\\B{y}}=A\\B{y}+\\B{b} \\qtq{with} \\B{y}(t_0)=\\B{y}_0, \\quad t \\in [t_0,t_f]$$\n$$\\text{where} \\quad \\B{y}(t)=\\Mat{y_1(t) \\\\ y_2(t) \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_K(t)}, \\quad A=\\Mat{a_{11} & a_{12} & \\dots & a_{1K} \\\\ a_{21} & a_{22} & \\dots & a_{2K} \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ a_{K1} & a_{K2} & \\dots & a_{KK}},$$\n$$\\B{b}=\\Mat{b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ b_K}, \\quad \\B{y}_0=\\Mat{\\tilde{y}_1 \\\\ \\tilde{y}_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\tilde{y}_K}.$$\nIn this case, $\\B{y}(t)$ is the unknown solution vector, $A$ is a matrix of constants, $\\B{y}_0$ is the vector of initial values and $\\B{b}$ is a vector of known terms (possibly depending on $t$) and is referred to as the ***Inhomogeneity*** or ***Forcing Term***.\n\nThe Euler iteration would be performed in a similar way as before.  First, the interval $[t_0,t_f]$ needs to be discretised into $N$ equally spaced subintervals, each of width $h$ to give the set of discrete times $(t_0, t_1, \\dots, t_N)$ where $t_n=t_0+nh$ for $n=0,1,\\dots,N$.

Case in point, when $h=1$, the approximate solution oscillates and grows quite rapidly, however choosing a smaller value of $h$, say $h=0.1$, gives a very good approximation to the exact solution.  These are illustrated in the figures below.\n\n![](figures/ODE6.jpg)\n![](figures/ODE7.jpg) \n\nAnother situation when the Euler method fails is when the IVP does not have a unique solution.  For example, consider the IVP:\n$$\\tdiff{y}=y^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\qtq{with} y(0)=0, \\quad t \\in [0,2].$$\nThis has the exact solution $y(t)=\\left( \\frac{2}{3}t \\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}}$ however this is not unique since $y(t)=0$ is also a perfectly valid solution.  The Euler method in this case will not be able to capture the first non-trivial solution but will only capture the second trivial solution giving a straight line at 0[^PC].\n\n[^PC]:  In general, according to the ***Picard-Lindelöf Theorem***, an IVP of the form $y'=f(t,y)$ with $y(0)=y_0$ has a *unique solution* if the function $f$ is continuous in $t$ and uniformly Lipschitz continuous in $y$.  In this example shown above, the function $f(t,y)=y^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ does not satisfy the aforementioned conditions and therefore the initial value problem does not have a unique solution.  These concepts of continuity are far beyond the realms of this course and no further mention of them will be made.\n\n### Bounds on the Stepsize\n\nConsider the initial value problem\n$$\\Btdiff{y}=A\\B{y}+\\B{b} \\qtq{with} \\B{y}(0)=\\B{y}_0.$$\nIf $A$ is asymptotically stable, then a maximum bound $h_0$ for the stepsize can be found to ensure that the iterations converge.  (This means that asymptotic stability of $A$ is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an upper bound $h_0$ such that if $h<h_0$, then the Euler iteration converges.)\n\nIf the stepsize is too large, then the method may not converge but on the other hand if it is too low, then the iteration will take a considerable amount of time to perform.  Therefore an \"optimal\" stepsize is needed to obtain sufficiently accurate solutions.\n\n:::{.callout-caution title=\"Different Stepsizes\"}\nConsider the following initial value problem\n$$\\tdiff{y}=100(\\sin(t)-y) \\qtq{with} y(0)=0.$$\nThe figure below shows the Euler method being used to solve the initial value problem in the interval $[0,1]$ for the stepsizes $h=0.03, 0.02, 0.01, 0.001$.\n\n![](figures/Unstable.jpg)\n\nWhen $h=0.03$, the Euler method does not converge.  At $h=0.02$, the Euler method converges but there clearly is a distinct artefact in the solution that shows a slight oscillation.

Suppose that the matrix $A$ is asymptotically stable (i.e. $\\Re(\\lambda_k)<0$ for all $k=1,2,\\dots,K$).  In order for the Euler iterations to converge, the stepsize $h$ needs be less than the threshold stepsize $h_0$ where\n$$h_0=2\\min_{k=1,2,\\dots,K}\\cbr{\\frac{|\\Re(\\lambda_k)|}{|\\lambda_k|^2}}$${#eq-h0Bound}\n$$\\tq{or} h_0=2 \\min_{k=1,2,\\dots,K} \\cbr{\\frac{1}{|\\lambda_k|}} \\quad \\text{if all the eigenvalues are real.}$$\nIn other words, if the initial value problem is asymptotically stable, then the Euler method is stable if an only if $h<h_0$.

Therefore, consider the three cases $0<h<\\frac{1}{3}$, $\\frac{1}{3}<h<1$ and $h>1$.\n\n1.  $0<h<\\frac{1}{3}$:  In this case, $1-h>0$ and $1-3h>0$, therefore $a=|1-h|+2h=1+h$ and $b=|1-3h|+4h=1+h$, hence $\\INorm{\\II+hA}=1+h$.  In order to satisfy $\\INorm{\\II+hA} \\leq 1$, this would mean that $h<0$ which contradicts with the fact that $h>0$.  Therefore $h \\notin \\nbr{0,\\frac13}$.\n\n2.  $\\frac{1}{3}<h<1$:  In this case, $1-h>0$ and $1-3h<0$, therefore $a=|1-h|+2h=1+h$ and $b=|1-3h|+4h=7h-1$.  This should now be split into two subcases to check which one will lead to a contradiction:\n     i. Suppose that $a>b$, then\n     $$1+h > 7h-1 \\qiq h<\\frac{1}{3}$$\n     which contradicts with $h>\\frac13$\n\tii. Suppose that $a<b$, then\n\t$$1+h < 7h-1 \\qiq h>\\frac{1}{3}$$\n\tnot leading to any contradiction.\ntherefore since $b>a$, then $\\INorm{\\II+hA}=b=7h-1$.\n\nIn order to satisfy $\\INorm{\\II+hA} \\leq 1$ then $h<\\frac{2}{7}$ which contradicts with the fact that $\\frac{1}{3}<h$.  Therefore $h \\notin \\nbr{\\frac13,1}$.\n\n3.  $h>1$:  In this case, $1-h<0$ and $1-3h<0$, therefore $a=|1-h|+2h=3h-1$ and $b=|1-3h|+4h=7h-1$.  Clearly $b>a$ since $h>0$, so $\\INorm{\\II+hA}=7h-1$.  In order to satisfy $\\INorm{\\II+hA} \\leq 1$ then $h<\\frac{2}{7}$ which contradicts with the fact that $h>1$.  This means that $h \\ngtr 1$.\n\nSo in every possible case, there will be a contradiction when using the sup-norm method.  This *does not* mean that the system is asymptotically unstable, in fact, the eigenvalues of the matrix $A$ are $-2 \\pm 2.65 \\ii$ meaning that the system is asymptotically stable and the threshold stepsize is in fact $h_0=0.0992$.\n\nThis example shows that the sup-norm method cannot be used for any matrix system, but if a matrix has a banded structure, then it would be appropriate and would require fewer computations compared to finding all the eigenvalues.\n:::\n\n## MATLAB Code\n\nThe following MATLAB code performs the Euler iteration for the following set of IVPs on the interval $[0,1]$:\n\\begin{align*}\n& \\tdiff{u}=2u+v+w+\\cos(t), & \\quad u(0)=0 \\\\\n& \\tdiff{v}=\\sin(u)+\\ex{-v+w}, & \\quad v(0)=1 \\\\\n& \\tdiff{w}=uv-w, & \\quad w(0)=0.\n\\end{align*}\n\n:::{.callout-note title=\"Linearity\"}\nNote that this code is built for a general case that *does not* have to be linear even though the entire derivation process was built on the fact that the system is linear.\n:::\n\n```matlab\nfunction IVP_Euler\n\n%% Solve a set of first order IVPs using Euler\n\n% This code solves a set of IVP when written explicitly\n% on the interval [t0,tf] subject to the initial conditions\n% y(0)=y0.
