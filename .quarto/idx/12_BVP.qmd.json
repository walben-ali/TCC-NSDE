In initial value problems, these conditions are imposed at the starting time but in boundary value problems, they are imposed at particular locations.\n\nOne of the most important differences when it comes to solving BVPs versus IVPs is the existence of solutions.  Solutions to initial value problems always *exist* and are *unique* (subject to certain restriction on the right hand side), this is as a consequence of the *Picard-Lindel√∂f* theorem.  The same cannot be said for boundary value problems; the solution to BVPs could exist and be unique, exist and not be unique or not exist at all.\n\n## Example of Boundary Value Problems\n\nConsider a mass $m$ hanging from a spring with spring constant $K$.  Suppose that the spring is extended (by pulling the mass) by a distance $x$ as seen below.\n![](figures/Spring.jpg)\n\nThen by *Hooke's Law*, the force pulling the mass back to its equilibrium position is given by\n$$F=-Kx.$$\nAs the mass is released, it will accelerate upwards with an acceleration $a$ and the force responsible for this acceleration is given by *Newton's Second Law of Motion*\n$$F=ma.$$\nThe acceleration $a$ is the second derivative of the displacement $x$ with respect to time and since it acts in a direction opposite to the extension, then\n$$a=-\\Odiff{x}{t}{2} \\qiq F=-m\\Odiff{x}{t}{2}$$\nEquating the two expressions for the force from Newton's Second Law and Hooke's Law will give\n$$-Kx=-m\\Odiff{x}{t}{2} \\qiq \\Odiff{x}{t}{2}+\\omega^2x=0 \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\omega=\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{m}}.$$\nThis differential equation represents the simple harmonic motion of a mass hanging on a frictionless massless spring which oscillates with a frequency $\\omega$.  Since this is a second order differential equation, two conditions need to be imposed:\n\n- *Initial conditions* can be imposed at the starting time, specifically $x(0)$ and $x'(0)$ which prescribe the initial position and initial speed,\n- *Boundary conditions* can be imposed at different times, say $x(0)$ and $x(10)$ which prescribe the location at time $t=0$ and time $t=10$.\n\n<!---\n### Heat Flux in a Pipe\n\nConsider the heat flow through a cylindrical pipe of across sectional area $A$ in the $x$ direction and let $q$ denote the heat flux in that direction.  It will be assumed that the temperature flux varies only along the length of the pipe.\n\n![](figures/Tube.jpg)\n\nFor a small cross section of the cylinder between $x$ and $\\delta x$, the heat flux in this region would be\n$$(q(x+\\delta x)-q(x))A.$$\nWithin this particular scenario, the pipe could be influenced by the external environment, say by heating or cooling at the ends of the pipe, this means that the heat transfer will have a dependence on $x$ only.  Denote this heat \"source\" per unit volume function as $f(x)$ (this could also be a heat \"sink\" per unit volume or a combination thereof).  Therefore within the small cylindrical region between $x$ and $x+\\delta x$, the temperature flux should be the product of the source function $f(x)$ and the volume of this small region which is $A\\delta x$.\n\nNow there are two expressions for the heat flux between $x$ and $x+\\delta x$ and they should balance one another and therefore (by the conservation of energy)\n$$(q(x+\\delta x)-q(x))A \\approx f(x) A \\delta x.$$\nThe expressions are not exactly equal since $\\delta x$ is quite small but non-zero and therefore, this can account for the discrepancy that could arise.  Diving both sides by $A \\delta x$ gives\n$$\\frac{q(x+\\delta x)-q(x)}{\\delta x} \\approx f(x).$$\nAs $\\delta x$ becomes tends to $0$, the approximation will become an equality\n$$\\lim_{\\delta x \\rightarrow 0}\\frac{q(x+\\delta x)-q(x)}{\\delta x} = f(x).$$\nThe left hand side of this equation is the $x$ derivative of the heat flux function $q(x)$, therefore\n$$\\odiff{q}{x} = f(x).$$\n\nIn most cases, heat flux can occur due to a combination of two factors, *Conduction* and *Convection*.  For conduction, the heat flux will be\n$$q_{cond}=-k_f \\odiff{T}{x}$$\nwhere $T$ is the temperature (which depends on the $x$ direction) and $k_f$ is the conductivity constant.  On the other hand, the heat flux for convection is\n$$q_{conv}=\\rho v C_p (T-T_{ref})$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density, $v$ is the steady state velocity of the flow, $C_p$ is the specific heat capacity and $T_{ref}$ is the reference temperature.  The overall heat flux will be assumed to be a combination of both conduction and convection, therefore\n$$q(x)=q_{cond}(x)+q_{conv}(x).$$\nAll the parameters of this system can be assumed to be constant, apart from the temperature $T$ of course.  Replacing $q(x)$ into the differential equation $q'=f(x)$ gives a second order differential equation for the temperature $T$ as\n$$-k_f \\Odiff{T}{x}{2}+\\rho v C_p \\odiff{T}{x}=f(x).$$\nSeeing as that this is a second order differential equation, it would need two conditions in order to yield a valid solution.  These can be boundary conditions at the inflow and outflow, which are labelled as $x=0$ and $x=L$ respectively.  In in the end, the boundary value problem would be posed thus\n$$-k_f \\Odiff{T}{x}{2}+\\rho v C_p \\odiff{T}{x}=f(x) \\qtq{with} T(0)=T_0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad T(L)=T_L.$$\n--->\n\n## Finite Difference Method for Boundary Value Problems {#sec-FDM}\n\nConsider the general second order boundary value problem\n$$a(x) \\Odiff{u}{x}{2}+b(x) \\odiff{u}{x}+c(x) u=f(x) \\qtq{with} 0< x < L$$\n$$\\text{and} \\quad u(0)=u_l, \\quad u(L)=u_r$$\nwhere the functions $a,b,c$ and $f$ are known functions of $x$.  Boundary value problems like this are solved using an incredibly versatile method known as the ***Finite Difference Method***.  This procedure essentially changes a differential equation into a set of difference equations by using approximations to the derivatives.\n\n## Existence & Uniqueness of Solutions to BVPs\n\nConsider the differential equation for the undamped simple harmonic oscillator with frequency 1, namely\n$$\\Odiff{u}{t}{2}=-u.$$\nThis differential equation has the general analytic solution\n$$u(t)=C_1 \\cos(t)+C_2 \\sin(t)$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants of integration which will be determined form the boundary conditions.\n\nThree qualitatively different sets of boundary conditions will be investigated:\n\n- $u(0)=1$ and $u(\\frac{5\\pi}{2})=-1$:\nThe constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ can be found as:\n$$1=u(0)=C_1 \\cos(0)+C_2 \\sin(0)=C_1 \\quad \\implies \\quad C_1=1$$\n$$-1=u\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{2}\\right)=C_1 \\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{2}\\right)+C_2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{2}\\right)=C_2 \\quad \\implies \\quad C_2=-1.$$\nTherefore the analytic solution to the boundary value problem subject to these conditions is\n$$u(t)=\\cos(t)-\\sin(t)$$\nand this is captured by the finite difference approximation.  In this case, the solution to the boundary value problem *exists* and is *unique*.\n\n- $u(0)=0$ and $u(2\\pi)=0$:\nThe constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ can be found as:\n$$0=u(0)=C_1 \\cos(0)+C_2\\sin(0)=C_1 \\quad \\implies \\quad C_1=0$$\n$$0=u(2\\pi)=C_1 \\cos(2\\pi)+C_2\\sin(2\\pi)=C_1 \\quad \\implies \\quad C_1=0.$$\nThese two conditions provide an expressions for the constant $C_1$ only and not $C_2$, therefore the particular solution will be\n$$u(t)=C_2\\sin(t)$$\nwhich is valid for *any* value of $C_2$.  Therefore in this case, the solution *exists* but is *not unique*.\n\n- $u(0)=1$ and $u(2\\pi)=-1$:\nThe constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ can be found as:\n$$1=u(0)=C_1 \\cos(0)+C_2\\sin(0)=C_1 \\quad \\implies \\quad C_1=1$$\n$$-1=u(\\pi)=C_1 \\cos(2\\pi)+C_2\\sin(2\\pi)=C_1 \\quad \\implies \\quad C_1=-1.$$\nIn this case, the boundary values have resulted in a contradiction and therefore the solution *does not exist* when subject to these boundary conditions.\n\nThis final case is when the solution to a boundary value problem does *not exist*.\n\n### Finite Difference Approximations to the Derivatives\n\nThe term *finite difference approximation* refers to how derivatives can be approximated using linear expressions.  For instance, the derivative of some function $f$ at a given point $X$ can be approximated as the gradient of $f$ between two points around $X$, for example\n$$\\odiff{f}{x}(X) \\approx \\frac{f(X+h)-f(X-h)}{2h}.$$\nThere are many other ways in which these approximations can be made depending on the way in which the grid has been set up or on the context of the problem.\n\nConsider a general unknown function $u(x)$ defined on $[0,L]$ where $u(0)$ and $u(L)$ are given (as boundary conditions).  First, split the interval into $N$ equally sized sections, each of width $h$, and label the points as $x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_N$ where $x_n=nh$.\n\n![](figures/Disc_Zoom.jpg)\n\nFor first and second derivatives, there are three main approximations that are most widely used:\n\n- **Forward Difference**:\n$$\\odiff{u}{x}(x_n) \\approx \\frac{u(x_{n+1})-u(x_n)}{h}$$\n$$\\Odiff{u}{x}{2}(x_n) \\approx \\frac{u(x_{n+2})-2u(x_{n+1})+u(x_n)}{h^2}$$\n- **Backward Difference**:\n$$\\odiff{u}{x}(x_n) \\approx \\frac{u(x_{n})-u(x_{n-1})}{h}$$\n$$\\Odiff{u}{x}{2}(x_n) \\approx \\frac{u(x_{n})-2u(x_{n-1})+u(x_{n-2})}{h^2}$$\n- **Centred Difference**:\n$$\\odiff{u}{x}(x_n) \\approx \\frac{u(x_{n+1})-u(x_{n-1})}{2h}$$\n$$\\Odiff{u}{x}{2}(x_n) \\approx \\frac{u(x_{n+1})-2u(x_{n})+u(x_{n-1})}{h^2}$$\n\nThe graphical interpretation of the approximations to the first derivatives are shown below.\n\n![](figures/FBC.jpg)\n\n:::{.callout-note title=\"Second Derivative Expression\"}\nTo show how the second derivative expressions are obtained, consider the centred difference approximation\n$$\\odiff{u}{x}(x_n) \\approx \\frac{u(x_{n+1})-u(x_{n-1})}{2h}.$$\n\nTo derive the expression for the second derivative, introduce two fictitious points $x_{n-0.5}$ (which is half-way between $x_{n-1}$ and $x_{n}$) and $x_{n+0.5}$ (which is half-way between $x_{n}$ and $x_{n+1}$).  Then\n\\begin{align*}\n\t\\Odiff{u}{x}{2}(x_n)=\\odiff{}{x}\\left( \\odiff{u}{x}(x_n) \\right) &\\approx \\odiff{}{x} \\left( \\frac{u(x_{n+0.5})-u(x_{n-0.5})}{h} \\right) \\\\ & \\approx \\frac{u'(x_{n+0.5})-u'(x_{n-0.5})}{h} \\\\ & \\approx \\frac{\\frac{u(x_{n+1})-u(x_{n})}{h}-\\frac{u(x_{n})-u(x_{n-1})}{h}}{h} \\\\ & = \\frac{u(x_{n+1})-2u(x_n)+u(x_{n-1})}{h^2}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe derivation of the second derivative approximations for the forward and backward differences can be done in a very similar way but without the need for half steps. \n:::\n\nAny of these three approximations can be used to approximate the derivatives of the function $u$ at the point $x_n$.  Denote the approximation of $u$ at the point $x_n$ by $U_n$, i.e. $U_n \\approx u(x_n)$, then\n\n- **Forward Difference**:\n$$\\odiff{u}{x}(x_n) \\approx \\frac{U_{n+1}-U_n}{h} \\quad ; \\quad \\Odiff{u}{x}{2}(x_n) \\approx \\frac{U_{n+2}-2U_{n+1}+U_n}{h^2}$$\n- **Backward Difference**:\n$$\\odiff{u}{x}(x_n) \\approx \\frac{U_{n}-U_{n-1}}{h} \\quad ; \\quad \\Odiff{u}{x}{2}(x_n) \\approx \\frac{U_{n}-2U_{n-1}+U_{n-2}}{h^2}$$\n- **Centred Difference**:\n$$\\odiff{u}{x}(x_n) \\approx \\frac{U_{n+1}-U_{n-1}}{2h} \\quad ; \\quad \\Odiff{u}{x}{2}(x_n) \\approx \\frac{U_{n+1}-2U_{n}+U_{n-1}}{h^2}.$$\n\nThese approximations will form the basis for solving the BVP.\n\n### Discretisation of the Differential Equation\n\nReturning to the differential equation\n$$a(x) \\Odiff{u}{x}{2}+b(x) \\odiff{u}{x}+c(x) u=f(x).$$\nEvaluate this equation at $x=x_n$ for some $n$, then\n$$a(x_n) \\Odiff{u}{x}{2}(x_n)+b(x_n) \\odiff{u}{x}(x_n)+c(x_n) u(x_n)=f(x_n).$$\n\nFor now, suppose the *centred differencing approximation* is used to approximate the derivatives.  Replacing the approximations of the derivatives of $u$ at $x_n$ gives\n$$a(x_n) \\frac{U_{n+1}-2U_n+U_{n-1}}{h^2}+b(x_n)  \\frac{U_{n+1}-U_{n-1}}{2h}+c(x_n) U_n=f(x_n).$$\nThis can be simplified by collecting the $U$ terms resulting in:\n$$\\alpha_n U_{n-1}+\\beta_n U_n+\\gamma_n U_{n+1}=f(x_n)$$\n$$\\text{where} \\quad \\alpha_n=\\frac{a(x_n)}{h^2}-\\frac{b(x_n)}{2h}, \\quad \\beta_n=-\\frac{2a(x_n)}{h^2}+c(x_n), \\quad \\gamma_n=\\frac{a(x_n)}{h^2}+\\frac{b(x_n)}{2h}.$$\nThis expression will hold for all the values of $n=1, 2, \\dots, N-1$ (otherwise there will be points $x_{-1}$ and $x_{N+1}$ which are outside the domain $[0,L]$).  Therefore, this mean that there will be $N-1$ equations in $N+1$ unknowns which are $U_0, U_1, U_2, \\dots, U_N$.\n\nThis system may seem to be undetermined however, there are two boundary conditions that have not been taken into consideration yet, namely $u(x_0)=u_l$ and $u(x_N)=u(L)=u_r$.  Since these are known, the approximations $U_0$ and $U_N$ have defined values, i.e. $U_0 \\approx u(x_0)=u_l$ and $U_N=u(x_N)=u_r$.  This eliminates two of the unknowns giving $N-1$ equations in $N-1$ unknowns.\n\nAt $n=1$, the approximation to the differential equation is\n$$\\alpha_1 U_{0}+\\beta_1 U_1+\\gamma_1 U_{2}=f(x_1)$$\nand since $U_0$ is already known, then it can be taken to the right hand side to give\n$$\\beta_1 U_1+\\gamma_1 U_{2}=f(x_1)-\\alpha_1 u_{0}.$$\nSimilarly, at $n=N-1$, the approximation is\n$$\\alpha_{N-1} U_{N-2}+\\beta_{N-1} U_{N-1}+\\gamma_{N-1} U_{N}=f(x_{N-1})$$\nand since $U_N$ is known, this can be rewritten as\n$$\\alpha_{N-1} U_{N-2}+\\beta_{N-1} U_{N-1}=f(x_{N-1})-\\gamma_{N-1} u_{L}.$$\nFor $n=2,3,\\dots,N-2$, the approximation is\n$$\\alpha_n U_{n-1}+\\beta_n U_n+\\gamma_n U_{n+1}=f(x_n)$$\nwhere $U_{n-1}, U_n$ and $U_{n+1}$ are al unknown.  In summary, all of these $N-1$ equations are:\n\\begin{align*}\n\tn=1: & \\quad \\; \\, {\\color{white}\\alpha_1 U_0+}\\beta_1 U_1+\\gamma_1 U_{2}=f(x_1)-\\alpha_1 u_{0} \\\\\n\tn=2: & \\quad \\alpha_2 U_{1}+\\beta_2 U_2+\\gamma_2 U_{3}=f(x_2) \\\\\n\tn=3: & \\quad \\alpha_3 U_{2}+\\beta_3 U_3+\\gamma_3 U_{4}=f(x_3) \\\\\n\t & \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\vdots \\\\\n\t n=N-3: & \\quad \\alpha_{N-3} U_{N-4}+\\beta_{N-3} U_{N-3}+\\gamma_{N-3} U_{N-2}=f(x_{N-3})\\\\\n\t n=N-2: & \\quad \\alpha_{N-2} U_{N-3}+\\beta_{N-2} U_{N-2}+\\gamma_{N-2} U_{N-1}=f(x_{N-2})\\\\\n\tn=N-1: & \\quad \\alpha_{N-1} U_{N-2}+\\beta_{N-1} U_{N-1}{\\color{white}}=f(x_{N-1})-\\gamma_{N-1} u_{L}\n\\end{align*}\nThese can be written in matrix form as $A \\B{U}=\\B{g}$, namely\n\\begin{multline*}\n\\underbrace{\\begin{pmatrix}\n\t\\beta_1  & \\gamma_1 & 0        & 0 & \\dots  & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\t\\alpha_2 & \\beta_2  & \\gamma_2 & 0 & \\dots  & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\t0        & \\alpha_3 & \\beta_3  & \\gamma_3 & \\dots  & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\t0 & 0       & \\alpha_4 & \\beta_4  & \\dots  & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\t\\vdots   & \\vdots   & \\vdots   & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n\t0        & 0        & 0        & 0 & \\dots  & \\beta_{N-4} & \\gamma_{N-4} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\t0        & 0        & 0        & 0 & \\dots  & \\alpha_{N-3} & \\beta_{N-3} & \\gamma_{N-3} & 0 \\\\\n\t0        & 0        & 0        & 0 & \\dots  & 0 & \\alpha_{N-2} & \\beta_{N-2} & \\gamma_{N-2} \\\\\n\t0        & 0        & 0        & 0 & \\dots  & 0 & 0 & \\alpha_{N-1} & \\beta_{N-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}}_{A}\n\\underbrace{\\begin{pmatrix}\n\tU_1 \\\\ U_2 \\\\ U_3 \\\\ U_4 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ U_{N-4} \\\\ U_{N-3} \\\\ U_{N-2} \\\\ U_{N-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}}_{\\B{U}} \\\\=\n\\underbrace{\\begin{pmatrix}\n\tf(x_1)-\\alpha_1 u_l \\\\ f(x_2) \\\\ f(x_3) \\\\ f(x_4) \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ f(x_{N-4}) \\\\ f(x_{N-3}) \\\\ f(x_{N-2}) \\\\ f(x_{N-1})-\\gamma_{N-1}u_r\n\\end{pmatrix}}_{\\B{g}}.\n\\end{multline*}\nThe matrix $A$ is of size $(N-1) \\times (N-1)$ all of whose terms are known, the vector $\\B{g}$ of size $(N-1) \\times 1$ also has terms that are all known.  The unknown vector here is $\\B{U}$ and it can be found by inverting $A$ to give $\\B{U}=A^{-1}\\B{g}$.\n\nCarrying out matrix inversions by hand can become increasingly cumbersome if $A$ is larger than $2 \\times 2$ and therefore this process should be done computationally.  This can be solved in MATLAB by using either `U=inv(A)*g` or `U=A\\g`.  The *backslash* method is faster than explicit matrix inversion if the matrix is of a large size.\n\nThe same process can be done for the forward and backward differencing approximations as well.\n\n### Steps of The Finite Difference Method\n\nIn summary, these are the steps of the finite difference method:\n\n1.  Divide the interval $[0,L]$ into $N$ equally sized sections, each of width $h=\\frac{L}{N}$ and label the points as $x_0, x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_N$ where $x_n=nh$.\n![](figures/Disc2.jpg)\n2.  The values of the function $u$ are to be found at all the locations $x_n$.  Denote the approximation to the function $u$ at the point $x_n$ by $U_n$, i.e. $U_n \\approx u(x_n)$ for all $n=0,1,2,\\dots,N$.\n3.  Evaluate the differential equation at all the points $x_n$ where the derivatives are replaced by their *finite difference approximations*.\n4.  This will result in a set of $N-1$ linear equations in $N+1$ unknowns, namely, $U_0, U_1, U_2, \\dots, U_N$.\n5.  The values for $U_0$ and $U_N$ are known from the boundary conditions, since $U_0=u(0)=u_l$ and $U_N=u(L)=u_r$ and no approximation is needed since the exact values are known.\n6.  Write the whole system of equations in the matrix form $A\\B{U}=\\B{g}$ and solve using MATLAB's backlash operator.\n\n::: {.callout-caution title=\"BVP Example\"}\nConsider the boundary value problem\n$$\\Odiff{u}{x}{2}=x^3, \\quad x \\in[0,2] \\qtq{with} u(0)=0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad u(2)=1.$$\nThe differential equation itself can be solved analytically to give\n$$u(x)=\\frac{1}{20}x^5-\\frac{3}{10}x.$$\nThis example will be used for the purposes of demonstration and comparison between the numerically obtained solution and the exact solution.\n\nSuppose the interval $[0,2]$ is to be divided into $5$ equally sized sections, therefore $N=5$ and $h=\\frac{L}{N}=\\frac{2}{5}=0.4$.\n![](figures/Disc04.jpg)\n\nThe functions $a(x), b(x), c(x)$ and $f(x)$ in this interval are:\n$$a(x)=1, \\quad b(x)=0, \\quad c(x)=0, \\quad f(x)=x^3.$$\n\nThe matrix values are\n$$\\alpha_n=\\frac{a(x_n)}{h^2}-\\frac{b(x_n)}{2h}=6.25$$\n$$\\beta_n=-\\frac{2a(x_n)}{h^2}+c(x_n)=-12.5$$\n$$\\gamma_n=\\frac{a(x_n)}{h^2}+\\frac{b(x_n)}{2h}=6.25.$$\n\nThese can be used to obtain expressions for the matrix $A$ and the vector $\\B{g}$ as\n$$\n\tA=\\begin{pmatrix}\n\t-12.5  &  6.25  &  0     & 0     \\\\\n\t 6.25  & -12.5  &  6.25  & 0     \\\\\n\t 0     &  6.25  & -12.5  & 6.25  \\\\\n\t 0     &  0     &  6.25  & -12.5 \n\t\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\B{g}=\\begin{pmatrix}\n\t0.064 \\\\ 0.512 \\\\ 1.728 \\\\ 4.096\n\t\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThis system can be solved using `U=inv(A)*g` or `U=A\\g`.  The numerical solution is compared to exact solution below.\n![](figures/BVP1.jpg)\n\nThe advantage of using this boundary value solver is that the computations are in no way taxing on MATLAB.  The system that results is composed entirely of linear equations and this system is solvable (provided the boundary value problem does indeed have a solution which may not always be possible).  MATLAB's backslash operator is very effective in dealing with matrices, especially owing to the fact that the matrix $A$ is a tridiagonal matrix.\n:::\n\n## MATLAB Code\n\nBelow is the MATLAB code that solves the BVP\n$$\\Odiff{u}{x}{2}+2\\tdiff{u}+\\ex{-x}u=\\sin(x), \\quad x \\in[0,10] \\qtq{with} u(0)=1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad u(10)=-1$$\nusing the centred differencing method with $N=50$.\n\n```matlab\nfunction BVP_CD\n\n%% Solve BVPs using centered differences\n\n% The bvp is written in the form\n% a(x) u'' + b(x) u' + c(x) u = f(x) on x in [x0,L]\n% with the boundary conditions u(x0)=ul and u(L)=ur.\n% After the centered difference approximation is\n% used, the system will be written in the form AU=g.\n\n%% Lines to change:\n\n% Line 26  : x0 - Start point\n% Line 29  : L  - End point\n% Line 32  : N  - Number of subdivisions\n% Line 35  : xl - Left boundary value\n% Line 38  : xr - Right boundary value\n% Line 119 : Expression for the function a(x)\n% Line 127 : Expression for the function b(x)\n% Line 135 : Expression for the function c(x)\n% Line 143 : Expression for the function f(x)\n\n%% Set up input values\n\n% Start point\nx0=0;\n\n% End point\nL=10;\n\n% Number of subdivisions\nN=50;\n\n% Boundary value at x=x0\nul=1;\n\n% Boundary value at x=L\nur=-1;\n\n%% Set up BVP solver parameters\n\n% Interval width\nh=(L-x0)/N;\n\n% X = Vector of locations\n% (x1, x2, x3, ..., xN) (notice the start is x1 NOT x0)\nX=x0+h:h:L;\n\n% Evaluate the functions a(x), b(x), c(x) and f(x) at X\naX=a(X);\nbX=b(X);\ncX=c(X);\nfX=f(X);\n\n% Find the expressions for alpha, beta and gamma at X\nalpha=aX/(h^2)-bX/(2*h);\nbeta=-2*aX/(h^2)+cX;\ngamma=aX/(h^2)+bX/(2*h);\n\n% Set up the vector g on the right hand side\ng=zeros(N-1,1);\ng(1)=fX(1)-alpha(1)*ul;\ng(N-1)=fX(N-1)-gamma(N-1)*ur;\nfor j=2:1:N-2\n    g(j)=fX(j);\nend\n\n% Set up the matrix A on the left hand side (LHS_A is\n% to avoid confusion with the function a(x))\nA=zeros(N-1,N-1);\nA(1,1)=beta(1);\nA(1,2)=gamma(1);\nA(N-1,N-1)=beta(N-1);\nA(N-1,N-2)=alpha(N-1);\nfor j=2:1:N-2\n    A(j,j-1)=alpha(j);\n    A(j,j)=beta(j);\n    A(j,j+1)=gamma(j);\nend\n\n% Solve for the unknown vector U (it is then readjusted\n% from a column vector to a row vector for plotting)\nU=A\\g;\nU=U';\n\n% Add the missing term x0 to the start of the vector x\nX=[x0,X];\n\n% Add the left and right boundary values to the vector U\nU=[ul,U,ur];\n\n%% Setting plot parameters\n\n% Clear figure\nclf\n\n% Hold so more than one line can be drawn\nhold on\n\n% Turn on grid\ngrid on\n\n% Setting font size and style\nset(gca,'FontSize',20,'FontName','Times')\n\n% Label the axes\nxlabel('$t$','Interpreter','Latex')\nylabel('$u(t)$','Interpreter','Latex')\n\n% Plot solution\nplot(X,U,'-k','LineWidth',2)\n\nend\n\nfunction [A]=a(X)\nA=zeros(size(X));\nfor i=1:1:length(X)\n    x=X(i);\n    A(i)=1;\nend\nend\n\nfunction [B]=b(X)\nB=zeros(size(X));\nfor i=1:1:length(X)\n    x=X(i);\n    B(i)=2;\nend\nend\n\nfunction [C]=c(X)\nC=zeros(size(X));\nfor i=1:1:length(X)\n    x=X(i);\n    C(i)=exp(-x);\nend\nend\n\nfunction [F]=f(X)\nF=zeros(size(X));\nfor i=1:1:length(X)\n    x=X(i);\n    F(i)=sin(x);\nend\nend\n```\n\n## Comparison Between Forward, Backward & Centred Difference Approximations\n\nThe main difference between the different differencing schemes if the order of accuracy.  Indeed, the error of the forward and backward differencing methods are $\\OO{h}$ whereas the error for the centred differencing is $\\OO{h^2}$.  This means that if the stepsize $h$ was reduced by  a factor of 10, then the error for the forward and backward finite difference approximations would also reduce by a factor of 10 while the centred would reduce by a factor of 100.\n\n::: {.callout-caution title=\"Comparison\"}\nConsider the BVP\n$$\\Odiff{u}{x}{2}=25\\pi^2 \\sin(5\\pi x), \\quad x \\in[0,1] \\qtq{with} u(0)=0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad u(1)=0.$$\n\nThis has the exact solution\n$$u(x)=-\\sin(5 \\pi x).$$\nBelow are the plots for the numerical solution to this boundary value problem using the forward (red), backward (blue) and centred (green) difference approximations compared to the exact solution when $N=10$.\n![](figures/BVP4.jpg)\n\nIt can be seen that even for this relatively crude interval subdivision of $N=10$, the centred approximation has yielded a far more favourable result compared to the other two methods.  The following table shows the 2-norm error between the exact solution and the approximation for different values of $N$:\n\n| Method   | $N=10$ | $N=20$ | $N=50$ | $N=100$ |\n|:--------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:-------:|\n| Forward  | 4.1444 | 3.0875 | 1.9823 | 1.4048  |\n| Backward | 4.7243 | 3.8535 | 2.0939 | 1.4251  |\n| Centred  | 0.5226 | 0.1677 | 0.0413 | 0.0146  |\n\nIt can be seen that even when $N=100$, the 2-norm error has still not reduced below 1 for the forward and backward difference approximations but the centred has already achieved that even at $N=10$.  This is just a demonstration to show that how a simple change in the way in which derivatives are approximated can have such a drastic effect on the final solution.\n:::\n\n## MATLAB's In-Built Procedures\n\nMATLAB has an in-built mechanism that can also solve second (or even higher order) BVPs, this is done using the `bvp4c` command.\n\nBelow is the MATLAB code that solves the
